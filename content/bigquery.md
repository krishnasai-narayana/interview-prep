## What is BigQuery, and how does it fit into the data engineering ecosystem?
BigQuery is a fully managed, serverless data warehouse solution provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It allows users to analyze and query large datasets using SQL, with high scalability and performance.






















## How does BigQuery handle data storage and processing?
BigQuery uses a distributed architecture for data storage and processing. It separates storage and compute, allowing users to scale each independently. Data is stored in Capacitor, a proprietary storage system, while processing is handled by Dremel, a distributed query execution engine.
