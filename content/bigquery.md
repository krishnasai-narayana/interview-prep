## What are the main components of a Hadoop Application?
Over the time, there are various forms in which a Hadoop application is defined. But in most of the cases there are following four core components of Hadoop application:
+ HDFS: This is the file system in which Hadoop data is stored. It is a distributed file system with very high bandwidth.
+ Hadoop Common_: This is common set of libraries and utilities used by Hadoop. 
+ Hadoop MapReduce: This is based on MapReduce algorithm for providing large-scale data processing.
+ Hadoop YARN: This is used for resource management in a Hadoop cluster. It can also schedule tasks for users.

## How does BigQuery handle data storage and processing?
BigQuery uses a distributed architecture for data storage and processing. It separates storage and compute, allowing users to scale each independently. Data is stored in Capacitor, a proprietary storage system, while processing is handled by Dremel, a distributed query execution engine.

[Table of Contents](#HADOOP)

## What are the key advantages of using BigQuery?
Some advantages of BigQuery include:
+ Scalability: It can handle massive datasets and query volumes.
+ Cost-effectiveness: Users only pay for the queries and storage they use.
+ Serverless architecture: No infrastructure management is required.
+ Integration with other GCP services: BigQuery can easily integrate with other GCP tools for data ingestion and processing.

## What is the difference between BigQuery and traditional relational databases?
BigQuery is a cloud-based, columnar data warehouse, whereas traditional relational databases are usually on-premises and row-based. BigQuery offers near-infinite scalability, while traditional databases have limitations based on hardware and storage capacity.

## Explain the concept of partitioning in BigQuery.
Partitioning in BigQuery involves dividing tables into smaller, more manageable parts based on specific criteria, such as a time range or key value. This helps improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned.

[Table of Contents](#HADOOP)
 
## What is clustering, and how does it optimize query performance?
Clustering in BigQuery involves organizing data within partitions based on the values of one or more columns. It improves performance by physically grouping related data together, allowing the query engine to skip irrelevant data during the execution of certain queries.

[Table of Contents](#HADOOP)
 
## How do you load data into BigQuery?
Data can be loaded into BigQuery using various methods, including:
+ Batch loading: Using the BigQuery web UI, command-line tools like bq, or API calls.
+ Streaming: Pushing individual records or small batches in real-time using the BigQuery streaming API.
+ Data transfer: Using services like Cloud Storage transfer service or Dataflow to load data into BigQuery.

[Table of Contents](#HADOOP)

## What are the different data export options in BigQuery?
BigQuery provides several options for exporting data, such as:
+ Exporting query results to Google Cloud Storage or a BigQuery table.
+ Exporting data to a Cloud Storage bucket using BigQuery Data Transfer Service.
